# Vanilla JavaScript Integration

<Note>
**Coming Soon:** Vanilla JavaScript integration for Laravel Chorus is currently in development and will be available in a future release.
</Note>

Vanilla JavaScript integration will provide:

- **Framework-agnostic core library** for maximum flexibility
- **Direct IndexedDB integration** with change tracking
- **WebSocket connection management** with automatic reconnection
- **Manual control** over optimistic updates and conflict resolution

Stay updated on progress by following the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/braedencrankd/laravel-chorus).

For now, we recommend using our [React Integration](/integrations/react) which provides the most complete Chorus experience.
