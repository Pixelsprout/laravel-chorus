## How Chorus Works

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[User Action] --> B[Optimistic Update]
    B --> C[IndexedDB]
    A --> D[Server Request]
    D --> E[Write Action]
    E --> F[Database]
    F --> G[Harmonic Created]
    G --> H[WebSocket Broadcast]
    H --> I[All Clients Updated]
```

1. **User performs an action** (create, update, delete)
2. **UI updates instantly** using optimistic updates
3. **Request processed** by server-side Write Actions
4. **Change broadcasted** as a "harmonic" to all connected clients
5. **All clients sync** the change to their local IndexedDB

## Use Cases

Chorus is perfect for applications requiring instant user feedback and real-time collaboration:

- **Messaging and chat applications**
- **Collaborative editing tools**
- **Project management dashboards**
- **Real-time analytics interfaces**
- **Social media feeds**
- **E-commerce with live inventory**
